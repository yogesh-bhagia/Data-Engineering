
Data Validation
________________
1. Data validation is a method for checking the accuracy and quality of your data, typically performed prior to importing and processing. 
2. It can also be considered a form of data cleansing. 
3. Data validation ensures that your data is complete (no blank or null values), unique (contains distinct values that are not duplicated), 
and the range of values is consistent with what you expect. 
4. Often, data validation is used as a part of processes such as ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) where you move data from a source database to a target 
data warehouse so that you can join it with other data for analysis. Data validation helps ensure that when you perform analysis, your results are accurate.



Steps to data validation
_________________________
Step 1: Determine data sample

Determine the data to sample. If you have a large volume of data, you will probably want to validate a sample of your data rather than the entire set. 
Youâ€™ll need to decide what volume of data to sample, and what error rate is acceptable to ensure the success of your project.

Step 2: Validate the database

Before you move your data, you need to ensure that all the required data is present in your existing database. 
Determine the number of records and unique IDs, and compare the source and target data fields.

Step 3: Validate the data format

Determine the overall health of the data and the changes that will be required of the source data to match the schema in the target. 
Then search for incongruent or incomplete counts, duplicate data, incorrect formats, and null field values.
